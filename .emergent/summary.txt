The AI engineer's work began by stabilizing and enhancing core features, particularly the Appointments page with Google Sheets synchronization and addressing initial WhatsApp integration issues. A significant architectural shift occurred when the user requested a move from  to  for improved WhatsApp stability, which led to a complete rewrite of the . The focus then expanded to implementing an Automations feature, though this was paused when the user pivoted to a comprehensive redesign of the Messages tab. This involved creating a robust 3-column layout, complex state management, integrating AI-based conversation classification via OpenRouter, and extensive debugging of backend API endpoints and MongoDB serialization issues (e.g., ). The engineer made multiple iterations on the Messages UI, reacting to detailed user feedback regarding corporate branding, color schemes, and structural improvements. The latest challenge involves fine-tuning the aesthetics of the Messages page to perfectly match the user's provided visual specifications, including specific color codes and separators.

The overarching goal is to develop a WhatsApp Web-like application without using the WhatsApp Business Cloud API. This includes automated appointment reminders, a dedicated Messages tab for WhatsApp integration, a Dashboard for metrics, and Patients management (listing, searching, adding/editing, bulk messaging). An Appointments section features an agenda view, reminders, Google Sheet synchronization, and a planned Confirmation Mode for bulk messaging. The Messages section evolved significantly, from basic display to a professional, responsive three-column layout with dynamic chat lists, a full chat area (with text/audio/file sending, template usage, message status), and a contact info panel. It also requires AI-powered conversation classification (Urgent, Requires Attention, Resolved) and integration with external Google Sheets data for patient context. A new Automations section was also partially specified, involving flow editors, consent templates, and AI configuration.

The AI engineer is currently focused on the Messages tab's frontend. After multiple iterations, including a complete architectural redesign to a 3-column professional layout and applying corporate colors, the user provided a final screenshot (Chat Message 505). This image details specific aesthetic requirements that were not fully met in the previous attempts. The AI engineer analyzed this latest screenshot and identified several key adjustments needed: specifically, the header background color for the left column must be , a thick, vibrant yellow separator () is required between columns, message bubbles need to be light blue for received and light gray for sent messages, and the right column's background should be white/pale gray. The WhatsApp client is currently disconnected, showing a QR code, which needs to be reconnected after the UI adjustments. The immediate task is to implement these precise aesthetic refinements in , , , and .
