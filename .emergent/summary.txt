The AI engineer's work began with a pre-existing but basic React/FastAPI application. The initial phase focused on refining the Appointments page, adhering to intricate design specifications, and setting up Google Sheets synchronization. This involved multiple iterations of UI adjustments for colors, sizes, and layout, followed by backend modifications to enhance the Appointment model and introduce new API endpoints. A significant challenge arose from data mapping inconsistencies between the Google Sheet, backend Pydantic models, and frontend display logic, leading to several debugging cycles where appointments were not visibly rendering. The engineer successfully resolved these by correcting field names and modifying the Pydantic model. Subsequently, a robust automatic synchronization mechanism using APScheduler was implemented. The current work revolves around addressing a non-functional WhatsApp QR code and implementing a Confirmation Mode for appointments. The AI engineer successfully installed Chromium to resolve Puppeteer issues but is currently debugging an infinite loop in the WhatsApp service.

<product_requirements>
The goal is to develop a web application mirroring WhatsApp Web, without using the WhatsApp Business Cloud API. Key functionalities include:
- All WhatsApp Web features (excluding group chats).
- Automated appointment reminders.
- A Messages tab for WhatsApp integration.
- Comprehensive corporate branding, including a custom sidebar, header, and overall aesthetic.
- A Dashboard displaying key metrics like appointments and priority conversations.
- A Patients management section for listing, searching, adding/editing patients (including family members), CSV import/bulk messaging, and deduplication.
- An Appointments management section with an agenda view, reminder selection, and synchronization with an external Google Sheet. This section has evolved to include detailed UI for appointment management (statistics, date navigation, detailed cards with actions) and a planned Confirmation Mode for bulk messaging.

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently addressing two main issues.
First, the Confirmation Mode feature on the  page is in progress. The UI elements (toggle, checkboxes, template selector, send button) have been added, and state management for selected appointments has been implemented. However, a JSX syntax error (unclosed tags) is preventing the frontend from rendering correctly, causing a SOMETHING_WENT_WRONG error on screenshot attempts.

Second, the  is not generating a valid QR code for linking WhatsApp. The AI engineer identified that the service was mocked and proceeded to rewrite  to use the actual  library. This involved updating the client initialization, endpoints, and event handlers. After attempting to run the service, an error  was encountered. Chromium was successfully installed (), but the service is now observed to be stuck in an infinite loop during initialization. The immediate task is to debug and resolve this loop to get the  client to function correctly and generate a valid QR code.

The application state is that the backend and the Appointments page's Agenda Mode are fully functional, with real-time Google Sheets synchronization and accurate display of appointments and statistics, but the Confirmation Mode and WhatsApp integration are currently broken.
