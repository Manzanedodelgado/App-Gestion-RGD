<analysis>
The AI engineer successfully built a full-stack WhatsApp-like application, adapting to iterative user feedback. Initial challenges included clarifying requirements and debugging the  integration, which was eventually mocked due to persistent Puppeteer issues. The engineer then systematically integrated the user's corporate branding across the frontend, including a custom layout, a statistics-rich Dashboard, and a comprehensive Patients management section with modular components (form, list, filters, bulk CSV sender). The process involved multiple code generations, dependency installations, service restarts, and screenshot verifications, demonstrating a robust development and debugging workflow. The current state is that the frontend is visually consistent and highly functional, with the WhatsApp service running in a mock state. The engineer is now poised to implement the Appointments section based on recently provided scripts.

<product_requirements>
The user requested a web application similar to WhatsApp Web, focused on creating new functionalities and enabling seamless WhatsApp connectivity via QR codes, *without* using the WhatsApp Business Cloud API.
Specific features requested include:
- All WhatsApp Web functionalities, excluding group options.
- Automated appointment reminder sending.
- Integration of WhatsApp within a Messages tab, maintaining an existing design (though the app was built from scratch).
- Implementation of a detailed corporate branding/design, including a custom sidebar, header, and overall aesthetic.
- A Dashboard to display key statistics (appointments, urgent/attention conversations).
- A Patients management section with capabilities for:
    - Listing and searching patients (titulars and family members).
    - Adding/editing patients, assigning family members, and handling contact statuses.
    - Importing contacts via CSV.
    - Sending bulk messages via CSV using templates.
    - Deduplicating contacts.
- An Appointments management section that handles an appointment agenda, allows selection of appointments for reminders, and syncs data from an external Google Sheet source.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Frontend**: React.js, Shadcn UI, Tailwind CSS,  for date manipulation,  for animations,  for real-time communication.
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python), MongoDB for data storage, , .
- **WhatsApp Integration**:  (initially attempted, currently mocked), Puppeteer (for headless browser control).
- **Service Orchestration**: Supervisorctl for managing backend, frontend, and WhatsApp service processes.
- **Data Synchronization**: Deno (serverless function) with Google Sheets API () for syncing appointments.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a full-stack architecture comprising a React frontend, a FastAPI backend, a MongoDB database, and a separate Node.js WhatsApp service. A Deno serverless function is used for Google Sheets integration.

<pending_tasks>
- Fully implement the  page using the three provided scripts for displaying, managing, and synchronizing appointments.
- Investigate and potentially re-implement the  integration to move beyond the current mocked QR code, if the user wishes for live WhatsApp functionality.

<current_work>
The AI engineer has just finished extensively updating the frontend to fully incorporate the user's corporate branding and design, and has refactored the Patients management section into modular components with advanced features like CSV import/bulk send and contact deduplication. The application's overall layout, dashboard, and patient pages now reflect the desired visual style. The  is running in a mocked state, displaying a static QR code. The immediate task at hand is the implementation of the  page. The AI engineer has received all three necessary scripts for this task: , , and . The engineer is currently preparing to integrate these into the application's architecture.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Implement the Appointments page in the frontend using the provided scripts and integrate them with the backend.
